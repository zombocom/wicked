Use wicked to make your Rails controllers into step-by-step wizards. To see Wicked in action check out the example [Rails app](https://github.com/schneems/wicked_example) or [watch the screencast](http://schneems.com/post/18437886598/wizard-ify-your-rails-controllers-with-wicked).

## Why

Many times I'm left wanting a RESTful way to display a step by step process that may or not be associated with a resource. Wicked gives the flexibility to do what I want while hiding all the really nasty stuff you shouldn't do in a controller to make this possible. At its core Wicked is a RESTful(ish) state machine, but you don't need to know that, just use it.

## Install

Add this to your Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'wicked'
```

Then run `bundle install` and you're ready to start

## How

We are going to build an 'after signup' wizard. If you don't have a `current_user` then check out how to [Build a step-by-step object with Wicked](https://github.com/schneems/wicked/wiki/Building-Partial-Objects-Step-by-Step).

First create a controller:

```
rails g controller after_signup
```

Add Routes into `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
resources :after_signup
```

Next include `Wicked::Wizard` in your controller

```ruby

class AfterSignupController < ApplicationController
  include Wicked::Wizard

  steps :confirm_password, :confirm_profile, :find_friends
  # ...

```

You can also use the old way of inheriting from `Wicked::WizardController`.

```ruby

class AfterSignupController < Wicked::WizardController

  steps :confirm_password, :confirm_profile, :find_friends
  # ...

```

The wizard is set to call steps in order in the show action, you can specify custom logic in your show using a case statement like below. To send someone to the first step in this wizard we can direct them to `after_signup_path(:confirm_password)`.

```ruby
class AfterSignupController < ApplicationController
  include Wicked::Wizard

  steps :confirm_password, :confirm_profile, :find_friends

  def show
    @user = current_user
    case step
    when :find_friends
      @friends = @user.find_friends
    end
    render_wizard
  end
end
```

**Note:** Wicked uses the `:id` parameter to control the flow of steps, if you need to have an id parameter, please use nested routes. See [building objects with wicked](https://github.com/schneems/wicked/wiki/Building-Partial-Objects-Step-by-Step) for an example. It will need to be prefixed, for example a Product's `:id` would be `:product_id`

You'll need to call `render_wizard` at the end of your action to get the correct views to show up.

By default the wizard will render a view with the same name as the step. So for our controller `AfterSignupController` with a view path of `/views/after_signup/` if call the :confirm_password step, our wizard will render `/views/after_signup/confirm_password.html.erb`

Then in your view you can use the helpers to get to the next step.

```erb
<%= link_to 'skip', next_wizard_path %>
```

You can manually specify which wizard action you want to link to by using the wizard_path helper.

```erb
<%= link_to 'skip', wizard_path(:find_friends) %>
```

In addition to showing sequential views we can update elements in our controller.


```ruby
class AfterSignupController < ApplicationController
  include Wicked::Wizard

  steps :confirm_password, :confirm_profile, :find_friends

  def update
    @user = current_user
    case step
    when :confirm_password
      @user.update(user_params)
    end
    sign_in(@user, bypass: true) # needed for devise
    render_wizard @user
  end
  
  private
  def user_params
    params.require(:user)
          .permit(:email, :current_password) # ...
  end
end
```

We're passing `render_wizard` our `@user` object here. If you pass an object into `render_wizard` it will show the next step if the object saves or re-render the previous view if it does not save.

Note that `render_wizard` does attempt to save the passed object. This means that in the above example, the object will be saved twice. This will cause any callbacks to run twice also. If this is undesirable for your use case, then calling `assign_attributes` (which does not save the object) instead of `update` might work better.

To get to this update action, you simply need to submit a form that PUT's to the same url

```erb
<%= form_for @user, url: wizard_path, method: :put do |f| %>
  <%=  f.password_field :password  %>
  <%=  f.password_field :password_confirmation  %>

  <%= f.submit "Change Password" %>
<% end %>
```

We explicitly tell the form to PUT above. If you forget this, you will get a warning about the create action not existing, or no route found for POST. Don't forget this.


In the controller if you find that you want to skip a step, you can do it simply by calling `skip_step`

```ruby
def show
  @user = current_user
  case step
  when :find_friends
    if @user.has_facebook_access_token?
      @friends = @user.find_friends
    else
      skip_step
    end
  end
  render_wizard
end
```

Now you've got a fully functioning AfterSignup controller! If you have questions or if you struggled with something, let me know on [twitter](http://twitter.com/schneems), and i'll try to make it better or make the docs better.

## Quick Reference

**View/URL Helpers:**

```ruby
wizard_path                  # relative url of the current step
wizard_path(:specific_step)  # relative url of a :specific_step
next_wizard_path             # relative url of the next step
previous_wizard_path         # relative url of the previous step

wizard_url                  # fully qualified url of the current step
wizard_url(:specific_step)  # fully qualified url of a :specific_step
next_wizard_url             # fully qualified url of the next step
previous_wizard_url         # fully qualified url of the previous step

# These only work while in a Wizard
# You can have multiple wizards in a project with multiple `wizard_path` calls
```


**Controller Tidbits:**

```ruby
steps  :first, :second                        # Sets the order of steps
step                                          # Gets current step
next_step                                     # Gets next step
previous_step                                 # Gets previous step
skip_step                                     # Tells render_wizard to skip to the next logical step
jump_to(:specific_step)                       # Jump to :specific_step
render_wizard                                 # Renders the current step
render_wizard(@user)                          # Shows next_step if @user.save, otherwise renders
render_wizard(@user, context: :account_setup) # Shows next_step if @user.save(context: :account_setup), otherwise renders
wizard_steps                                  # Gets ordered list of steps
current_step?(step)                           # is step the same as the current request's step
past_step?(step)                              # does step come before the current request's step in wizard_steps
future_step?(step)                            # does step come after the current request's step in wizard_steps
previous_step?(step)                          # is step immediately before the current request's step
next_step?(step)                              # is step immediately after the current request's step
```

**Redirect options**

Both `skip_step` and `jump_to` will cause a redirect.

```
skip_step(foo: "bar")
```

*Note that unlike you would do when making a call to Rails' `redirect_to`, you should not call `return` immediately after `skip_step` and `jump_to`, since the actual redirection is done in the render_wizard call.*

If you want to pass params to the step you are skipping to you can pass it into those:

```
jump_to(:specific_step, foo: "bar")
```

**Finally:**

Don't forget to create your named views

```
app/
  views/
    controller_name/
      first.html.erb
      second.html.erb
      # ...
```


## Finish Wizard Path

You can specify the url that your user goes to by over-riding the `finish_wizard_path` in your wizard controller.


```ruby
def finish_wizard_path
  user_path(current_user)
end
```

### Testing with RSpec

```ruby
# Test find_friends block of show action
get :show, params: { id: :find_friends }

# Test find_friends block of update action
patch :update, params: {'id' => 'find_friends', "user" => { "id" => @user.id.to_s }}
```

### Internationalization of URLS (I18n)

If your site works in multiple languages, or if you just want more control over how your URLs look you can now use I18n with wicked. To do so you need to replace this:

```ruby
include Wicked::Wizard
```

With this:

```ruby
include Wicked::Wizard::Translated
```

This will allow you to specify translation keys instead of literal step names. Let's say you've got steps that look like this:

    steps :first, :second

So the urls would be `/after_signup/first` and `/after_signup/second`. But you want them to show up differently for different locales. For example someone coming form a Spanish speaking locale should see `/after_signup/uno` and `after_signup/dos`.

To internationalize first you need to create your locales files under `config/locales` such as `config/locales/es.yml` for Spanish. You then need to add a `first` and `second` key under a `wicked` key like this:

```yaml
es:
  hello: "hola mundo"
  wicked:
    first: "uno"
    second: "dos"
```

It would also be a good idea to create a english version under `config/locales/en.yml` or your english speaking friends will get errors. If your app already uses I18n you don't need to do anything else, if not you will need to make sure that you set the `I18n.locale` on each request you could do this somewhere like a before filter in your application_controller.rb

```ruby
before_action :set_locale

private

def set_locale
  I18n.locale = params[:locale] if params[:locale].present?
end

def default_url_options(options = {})
  {locale: I18n.locale}
end
```

For a screencast on setting up and using I18n check out [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/episodes/138-i18n-revised). You can also read the [free I18n Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html).

Now when you visit your controller with the proper locale set your URLs should be more readable like `/after_signup/uno` and `after_signup/dos`.

Wicked expects your files to be named the same as your keys, so when a user visits `after_signup/dos` with the `es` locale it will render the `second.html.erb` file.


**Important:** When you do this the value of `step` as well as
`next_step` and `previous_step` and all the values within `steps` will
be translated to what locale you are using. To translate them to the
"canonical" values that you've have in your controller you'll need so
use `wizard_value` method.

For example, if you had this in your controller, and you converted it to
a use Wicked translations, so this will not work:

```ruby
steps :confirm_password, :confirm_profile, :find_friends

def show
  case step
  when :find_friends
    @friends = current_user.find_friends
  end
  render_wizard
end
```

Instead you need to use `wizard_value` to get the "reverse translation" in your controller code like this:

```ruby
steps :confirm_password, :confirm_profile, :find_friends

def show
  case wizard_value(step)
  when :find_friends
    @friends = current_user.find_friends
  end
  render_wizard
end
```

The important thing to remember is that `step` and the values in `steps` are
always going to be in the same language if you're using the Wicked translations.
If you need any values to match the values set directly in your controller,
 or the names of your files (i.e. `views/../confirm_password.html.erb`, then you need
to use `wizard_value` method.

## Custom URLs

Very similar to using I18n from above but instead of making new files for different languages, you can stick with one language. Make sure you are using the right module:

```ruby
include Wicked::Wizard::Translated
```

Then you'll need to specify translations in your language file. For me, the language I'm using is english so I can add translations to `config/locales/en.yml`

```yaml
en:
  hello: "hello world"
  wicked:
    first: "verify_email"
    second: "if_you_are_popular_add_friends"
```

Now you can change the values in the URLs to whatever you want without changing your controller or your files, just modify your `en.yml`. If you're not using English you can set your default_locale to something other than `en` in your `config/application.rb` file.

```ruby
config.i18n.default_locale = :de
```

**Important:** Don't forget to use `wizard_value()` method to make
sure you are using the right canonical values of `step`,
`previous_step`, `next_step`, etc. If you are comparing them to non
wicked generate values.

Custom crafted wizard urls: just another way Wicked makes your app a little more saintly.

## Dynamic Step Names

If you wish to set the order of your steps dynamically you can do this by manually calling  and `self.steps = [# <some steps> ]` in a `before_action` method. Then call `before_action :setup_wizard` after so that wicked knows when it is safe to initializelike this:

```ruby
include Wicked::Wizard
before_action :set_steps
before_action :setup_wizard

# ...

private
def set_steps
  if params[:flow] == "twitter"
    self.steps = [:ask_twitter, :ask_email]
  elsif params[:flow] == "facebook"
    self.steps = [:ask_facebook, :ask_email]
  end
end
```

NOTE: The order of the `before_action` matters, when `setup_wizard` is called it will validate the presence of `self.steps`, you must call your custom step setting code before this point.

## Send params to finish_wizard_path method

If you wish to send parameters to the `finish_wizard_path` method that can be done by adding to your controller the method with the params argument `def finish_wizard_path(params) ... end`.

In order to send the parameters to the method here is an example of the show method:

```ruby
steps :first_step, :second_step

def show
  # ...
  render_wizard(nil, {}, { hello: 'world' })
end

def update
  # ...
  render_wizard(@user, {}, { hello: 'world' })
end

def finish_wizard_path(params)
  # here you can access params and that would be equal to { hello: 'world' }
end
```

The `wizard_path` and `next_wizard_path` methods also take parameters that can then be accessed or visible in the `show` and `update` actions of the controller. You can use the methods like so:

```ruby
next_wizard_path({ hello: 'world' })
wizard_path(nil, { hello: 'world' })
# the wizard_path with the step specified would look like this
wizard_path(:wicked_finish, wizard_id: @user.id, hello: 'world')
```

## Keywords

There are a few "magical" keywords that will take you to the first step,
the last step, or the "final" action (the redirect that happens after
the last step). Prior to version 0.6.0 these were hardcoded strings. Now
they are constants which means you can access them or change them. They
are:

```ruby
Wicked::FIRST_STEP
Wicked::LAST_STEP
Wicked::FINISH_STEP
```

You can build links using these constants
`after_signup_path(Wicked::FIRST_STEP)` which will redirect the user to
the first step you've specified. This might be useful for redirecting a
user to a step when you're not already in a Wicked controller. If you
change the constants, they are expected to be strings (not symbols).

## Support

Most problems using this library are general problems using Ruby/Rails. If you cannot get something to work correctly please open up a question on [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). If you've not posted there before, provide a description of the problem you're having and usually some example code and a copy of your rails logs helps.

If you've found a bug, please open a ticket on the issue tracker with a small example app that reproduces the behavior.

## About

Made by [@schneems](http://twitter.com/schneems).

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.

## Compatibility

Refer to the Travis CI test matrix for test using your version of Ruby and Rails. If there is a newer Ruby or Rails you don't see on there, please add an entry to the Appraisals file, then run `$ appraisals install` and update the `.travis.yml` file and send me a pull request.

Note: Rails 3.0 support is only for Ruby 1.9.3 or JRuby, not Ruby 2.0.0 or newer.

## Running Gem Tests

First, install the development gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Now that `appraisal` is installed, use it to set up all the gemfiles for the test matrix:

```
$ appraisal install
```

Then to run tests against all the appraisal gemfiles, use:

```
$ appraisal rake test
```

To run tests against one specific gemfile,
use

```
$ appraisal 4.1 rake test
```

Note that Rails 3.0 tests don't pass in Ruby 2.0.0 or newer, so during development it may be easier to disable this
gemfile if you are using a current version of Ruby.
